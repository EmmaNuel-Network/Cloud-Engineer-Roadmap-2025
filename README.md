## Overview
This repository follows a progressive roadmap designed to build professional-level skills in:

- Networking fundamentals  
- Linux system administration  
- Git & Bash  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
- AWS cloud engineering (from basics to intermediate)  
- Containerization (Docker)  
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)  
- CI/CD automation  
- Observability  
- Final senior-level cloud project  
- Certification preparation  

The goal is to move from fundamentals → automation → cloud engineering → DevOps workflows → production-grade cloud architectures.
